    "## The Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of a list of the top tracks to have come out between 1956 and 2019 that are available on Spotify. It contains information about the track and how it scales across multiple sound features. The dataset was extracted from the playlist, “Top 2000s”, on Spotify. The data was then passed to PlaylistMachinery(@plamere), which was then able to retrieve attributes per song in the playlist. Sumat Singh then scraped the data from the site using Python with Selenium to form the dataset that the group will be using for the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 15 different columns that represent an attribute as well as 1995 different rows wherein 1994 of them represent an observation with 1 representing the column names, thus giving it a shape of (1995,15).\n",
    "\n",
    "The column/variables consist of: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Title`**: Title of the track.\n",
    "- **`Artist`**: Artist/group who made the track.\n",
    "- **`Top Genre`**: Genre of the track.\n",
    "- **`Year`**: Year the track was released.\n",
    "- **`Length`**: Duration of the track in seconds.\n",
    "- **`Beats Per Minute`**: Average count of beats per 1 minute interval of the track.\n",
    "- **`Energy`**: Scale measuring how energetic and upbeat the track is. The higher the value, the more energetic.\n",
    "- **`Danceability`**: Scale measuring how usable the track is for dancing. The higher the value, the more danceable.\n",
    "- **`Loudness`**: Scale measuring how loud the track is, measured in decibels. The higher the value, the louder.\n",
    "- **`Valence`**: Scale measuring the mood of the song, whether it be positive or negative. The higher the value, the more positive.\n",
    "- **`Accoustic`**: Scale measuring how acoustic the track is. The higher the value, the more acoustic.\n",
    "- **`Speechiness`**: Scale measuring the track’s word count. The higher the value, the more words were used.\n",
    "- **`Liveliness`**: Scale measuring the likeliness that it is a live recording. The higher the value, the more likely it is that the track was recorded live.\n",
    "- **`Popularity`**: Scale measuring how popular the song is. The higher the value, the more popular the song is as of 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this data was taken by PlaylistMachinery from the Spotify API. More detailed descriptions of the audio features can be seen in [Spotify's Web API Documentation.](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-audio-features)\n",

    "Based on the results of our EDAs, we found that the `danceability` feature had varying averages across different genres, with some genres having similar averages. This leads us to question whether we could possibly find similar average values for other song features across genres, and find out how many features between certain genres are similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also found evidence that a couple of sound features had relationships between them. These correlations lead us to believe that these sound features could possibly be utilized to find relationships and similarities between the different genres as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also discovered that the the 95% confidence interval for all the songs across all genres in the dataset was between 58.71 and 60.65. To find out if certain genres are similar from another, it would be important to look at their confidence interval. If the intervals overlap, it can be said that the difference between them are not statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",

    "Music is arguably one of mankind's most significant innovations as it is able to transcend past the visual barriers and limitations by stimulating our imagination and emotions through sound. From Beethoven's Waldstein, to Tupac's All Eyez on Me, to Taylor Swift's Midnight Rain; each and every one of these songs from completely different genre's are able to tell different stories and provoke different emotions. With that said, given the amount of songs and genres available, it can be quite difficult to find the right songs given a certain taste in music. \n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to know which genres go well or are similar with others can definitely help the selection and filtration process. The group plans to answer this question with the use of cossine similarity and data mining techniques, such as clustering, using the given sound feature data per genre. The resulting data may also be used in recommender systems for music platforms, much like Spotify, to boost their efficiency by manipulating the algorithm into looking for suggestions from genres in the same or closest clusters first, instead of searching for recommendations randomly across the different genres."
