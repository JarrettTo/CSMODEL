    "## The Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of a list of the top tracks to have come out between 1956 and 2019 that are available on Spotify. It contains information about the track and how it scales across multiple sound features. The dataset was extracted from the playlist, “Top 2000s”, on Spotify. The data was then passed to PlaylistMachinery(@plamere), which was then able to retrieve attributes per song in the playlist. Sumat Singh then scraped the data from the site using Python with Selenium to form the dataset that the group will be using for the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 15 different columns that represent an attribute as well as 1995 different rows wherein 1994 of them represent an observation with 1 representing the column names, thus giving it a shape of (1995,15).\n",
    "\n",
    "The column/variables consist of: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Title`**: Title of the track.\n",
    "- **`Artist`**: Artist/group who made the track.\n",
    "- **`Top Genre`**: Genre of the track.\n",
    "- **`Year`**: Year the track was released.\n",
    "- **`Length`**: Duration of the track in seconds.\n",
    "- **`Beats Per Minute`**: Average count of beats per 1 minute interval of the track.\n",
    "- **`Energy`**: Scale measuring how energetic and upbeat the track is. The higher the value, the more energetic.\n",
    "- **`Danceability`**: Scale measuring how usable the track is for dancing. The higher the value, the more danceable.\n",
    "- **`Loudness`**: Scale measuring how loud the track is, measured in decibels. The higher the value, the louder.\n",
    "- **`Valence`**: Scale measuring the mood of the song, whether it be positive or negative. The higher the value, the more positive.\n",
    "- **`Accoustic`**: Scale measuring how acoustic the track is. The higher the value, the more acoustic.\n",
    "- **`Speechiness`**: Scale measuring the track’s word count. The higher the value, the more words were used.\n",
    "- **`Liveliness`**: Scale measuring the likeliness that it is a live recording. The higher the value, the more likely it is that the track was recorded live.\n",
    "- **`Popularity`**: Scale measuring how popular the song is. The higher the value, the more popular the song is as of 2019.\n",

If the intervals overlap, it can be said that the difference between them are not statistically significant.\n",

From Beethoven's Waldstein, to Tupac's All Eyez on Me, to Taylor Swift's Midnight Rain; each and every one of these songs from completely different genre's are able to tell different stories and provoke different emotions. With that said, given the amount of songs and genres available, it can be quite difficult to find the right songs given a certain taste in music. \n",

The group plans to answer this question with the use of cossine similarity and data mining techniques, such as clustering, using the given sound feature data per genre. The resulting data may also be used in recommender systems for music platforms, much like Spotify, to boost their efficiency by manipulating the algorithm into looking for suggestions from genres in the same or closest clusters first, instead of searching for recommendations randomly across the different genres."

Low `valence` indicates more negative-sounding songs, which can have emotions such as sadness, depression, anger, etc. But because its `energy` is really low relatively speaking, we can speculate that the songs in this cluster have more of an sad and depressive mood because of the assumption that songs with a sadder, melancholic mood would have less `energy` as well. Its high marks in `acousticness` also supports this assumption, as a lot of sad and emotional songs tend to be sang acoustically. \n",

    "Based on our statistical inference and  clustering analysis, we've been able to somewhat conclude which genres are similar based on some of the different sound features used by Spotify, such as `energy`, `danceability`, `acousticness`, `valence`, and `speechiness`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've found that it was quite difficult to define and highlight a relationship of similarity between two or multiple genres due to the variety of songs each of them cover. However, we believe that we've found sufficient evidence to prove that certain genres can be grouped together based on these sound attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 0 was heavily dominated by `rock` and `metal` genres, as well as genres that tend to have high `energy` and low `acousticness`. This included album rock and alternative metal. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, slower and more emotional songs were most prominent in Cluster 1, taking over 40% of songs from the genre, `adult standards`. It's also home to a large chunk of genres `dutch indie` and `dutch pop`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster 2 can be described to be more \"Musical-ish\", with very upbeat and acoustic tones that make it very easy to dance to. You can also find a huge portion of `dutch cabaret` and `british invasion` in here. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Cluster 3, you can expect to find more electronic, upbeat, and danceable genres such as `dance pop` , `album rock` and `dance rock`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, in Cluster 4 is where you can find genres with songs that tend be slower and moodier in nature, such as `dutch pop` and `adult standards`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among all the genres, though, `album rock` topped pretty much all of the clusters. The fact that it was the genre with the most amount of value counts in the dataset may have contributed to that. However, upon our research, `album rock` is a loosely-bound genre itself. It doesn't necessarily refer to a specific style of rock, but rather its format--rock songs that are part of an album. Because of this, `album rock` attributes naturally vary, and so some album rock songs can be more similar to more heavy rock-oriented genres such as `alternative metal`, while others can be more similar to `pop` or other pop genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another prominent genre among the clusters was `adult standards`. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adult_standards), the adult standards genre \"is aimed at 'mature' adults, meaning mainly those people over 50 years of age, but it is mostly targeted for senior citizens.\" Similar to `album rock`, it can encompass a fairly wide range of genres as well, and is more indicative of its format than its musical qualities. However, artists commonly associated with `adult standards` such as Frank Sinatra and Ella Fitzgerald do have music which can be described as less \"energetic\" than music in later decades. As such, it's no wonder the genre was absent in `Cluster 0`, which was dominated by heavy rock genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the analysis and process, we've realized that songs under a single genre can be quite varying in terms of sound features, at least a lot more than we initially expected, which definitely affected the results and steps we needed to take in order to achieve them. With that said, although no set genre is fully defined by a single cluster, the clustering process still helped us identify which genres are vaguely similar by taking a closer look at the sound features per cluster, which was obtained using the centroids used during the clustering process. These sound features helped us understand the relationships between the genres more, and gave us insight as to how they could be perceived as similar."
