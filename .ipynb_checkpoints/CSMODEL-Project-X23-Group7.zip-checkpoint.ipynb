    "## The Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of a list of the top tracks to have come out between 1956 and 2019 that are available on Spotify. It contains information about the track and how it scales across multiple sound features. The dataset was extracted from the playlist, “Top 2000s”, on Spotify. The data was then passed to PlaylistMachinery(@plamere), which was then able to retrieve attributes per song in the playlist. Sumat Singh then scraped the data from the site using Python with Selenium to form the dataset that the group will be using for the analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains 15 different columns that represent an attribute as well as 1995 different rows wherein 1994 of them represent an observation with 1 representing the column names, thus giving it a shape of (1995,15).\n",
    "\n",
    "The column/variables consist of: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **`Title`**: Title of the track.\n",
    "- **`Artist`**: Artist/group who made the track.\n",
    "- **`Top Genre`**: Genre of the track.\n",
    "- **`Year`**: Year the track was released.\n",
    "- **`Length`**: Duration of the track in seconds.\n",
    "- **`Beats Per Minute`**: Average count of beats per 1 minute interval of the track.\n",
    "- **`Energy`**: Scale measuring how energetic and upbeat the track is. The higher the value, the more energetic.\n",
    "- **`Danceability`**: Scale measuring how usable the track is for dancing. The higher the value, the more danceable.\n",
    "- **`Loudness`**: Scale measuring how loud the track is, measured in decibels. The higher the value, the louder.\n",
    "- **`Valence`**: Scale measuring the mood of the song, whether it be positive or negative. The higher the value, the more positive.\n",
    "- **`Accoustic`**: Scale measuring how acoustic the track is. The higher the value, the more acoustic.\n",
    "- **`Speechiness`**: Scale measuring the track’s word count. The higher the value, the more words were used.\n",
    "- **`Liveliness`**: Scale measuring the likeliness that it is a live recording. The higher the value, the more likely it is that the track was recorded live.\n",
    "- **`Popularity`**: Scale measuring how popular the song is. The higher the value, the more popular the song is as of 2019.\n",

The group plans to answer this question with the use of cossine similarity and data mining techniques, such as clustering, using the given sound feature data per genre. The resulting data may also be used in recommender systems for music platforms, much like Spotify, to boost their efficiency by manipulating the algorithm into looking for suggestions from genres in the same or closest clusters first, instead of searching for recommendations randomly across the different genres."
